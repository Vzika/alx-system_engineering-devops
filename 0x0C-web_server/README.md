0x0C. Web server

man scp:
scp [options] source destination
Here's what each part of the command does:

scp: The command itself.
options: Optional flags that modify the behavior of the scp command.
source: The file or directory you want to copy. This can be a local file/directory path or a remote file/directory path in the format [user@]host:file.
destination: The location where you want to copy the file or directory. Similarly, it can be a local or remote path.

Here are some common options used with scp:

-r: Recursively copy entire directories.
-P <port>: Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.
-i <identity_file>: Specifies the identity file (private key) for authentication.

For example, to copy a file named file.txt from your local machine to a remote server:
scp file.txt user@remote_host:/path/to/destination

And to copy a file from a remote server to your local machine:
scp user@remote_host:/path/to/file.txt /local/path/to/destination



StrictHostKeyChecking=no

When using scp (secure copy) to transfer files between systems, the SSH protocol is utilized for secure communication. One of the security features of SSH is host key checking, which verifies the authenticity of the host you are connecting to.

Here's what it means to disable "Strict host key checking" and why it might be done:

Strict Host Key Checking: Normally, when you connect to a remote host for the first time via SSH, your SSH client will check if the host's key is already stored in your known_hosts file. If not, it will prompt you to confirm whether you want to continue connecting, as the host's authenticity cannot be verified. This prevents potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

Disabling Strict Host Key Checking: In some automated or scripted scenarios, such as when using scp within a script or for automated tasks, this manual confirmation can be problematic as it halts the process. Disabling strict host key checking (StrictHostKeyChecking=no) bypasses this prompt and automatically adds the host's key to your known_hosts file, assuming the host key has not changed since the last connection attempt.

However, disabling strict host key checking can be risky, especially in security-sensitive environments, as it leaves you vulnerable to potential security threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks. Therefore, it should be used cautiously and only in trusted environments where the risk is deemed acceptable.

In summary, disabling strict host key checking (StrictHostKeyChecking=no) in scp commands is a way to automate file transfers without being prompted to confirm the authenticity of the host's key, but it should be done judiciously and with an understanding of the associated security implications.
